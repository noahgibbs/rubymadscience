# RubyMadScience Class Software

RubyMadScience was courseware, tracking steps taken in learning various topics. At this point it's shut down - maintaining anything that sends email on the internet makes it a spam magnet, even if you're careful not to let it be *usefully* abusable.

For how this software was initially written, step by step, see https://codefol.io/tags/rubymadscience
