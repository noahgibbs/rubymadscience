# Further possible improvements, organised by what effect they might have

## Login

* Twitter or GitHub login would be a really good idea

## Public Users

It would be nice for users to show off their RMS progress.

* Users should be able to opt into their RMS info being 'public' - shown to others
* It should be possible to add a note/comment when completing a step, which would be visible for public users

## Publicising

I'd like RMS to help publicise itself.

* It'd be nice for the app to post a topic to an RMS-specific Twitter over time, one step at a time

### Anonifying

It'd be nice if a user could choose to be anonymised, so their info was public but their name didn't have to be.

* Some kind of Markov-generator technique for anonymous names
* Anon'd names don't really need to be unique, just high-cardinality
* A given user can be public or anon'd
* Some kinds of data don't want to be public, so there should be a "force anon for all displayed users" mode for some views, and probably as a site mode to force for all views

## Personalising

It would be great if users could get access to specific stuff *for them*, not just the same topics as everybody else.

* Pull down Gumroad data on purchasers to expose/emphasise "hey, you own this thing"
* Pull down Gumroad data on purchasers to send Slack invite to (only) new purchasers

## Onboarding

* Use shepherdjs to explain about topics-as-subscriptions (not 100% the same as classes) and generally show the user around.

## Admin / Audit Trail

* Need (effectively) an audit trail - what changes have been made to topics in done-ness? what's current state of a Topic/user combo
* Would like to have site activity - what has happened recently for all users, ordered by time?
